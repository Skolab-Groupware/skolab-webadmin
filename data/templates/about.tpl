<h1>{t}Skolab Groupware Solution{/t}</h1>
<p>
{t escape=no 1="http://fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware" 2="http://das-netzwerkteam.de/"}This is the server of the Skolab Groupware Solution, a <a href=%1>Free
Software</a> Personal Information Management (PIM) solution developed by
<a href=%2>DAS-NETZWERKTEAM</a>.
{/t}
</p>

<p>
{t escape=no}The project was derived from an old version (v2) of the Kolab Groupware
starting in 2017 at the Debian Conference in Montreal. Good and working
solutions must be sustained, so we started working on the contiuation of
Kolab v2 under a slightly different name: Skolab Groupware.
